    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>What I think is in the black box is bottles/containers with some sort of tubing system for the water to travel through.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>When we put water in our box that we built, water didn’t come out for the first couple trials because the containers weren’t filled up all the way. Once they got filled water came out the bottom but it was less than what we put in. </p>
    <h1>Reasoning, Part 1 </h1>
    <p>A model is when you have a replica of something that you or someone else built that works like an actual one. I know this because we made our own models of a black box with what we think is inside of it.</p>
  <h1>Reasoning, Part 2</h1>
<p>My evidence supports my claim because every time we put water in different amounts of water came out, if it wasn’t like the actual black box the same amount of water would have come out.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning, Part 3</h1>
    <p>If there were not containers with tubing inside the black box, then my data would be different. Specifically, it might change by maybe more water will come out or maybe less will</p>
